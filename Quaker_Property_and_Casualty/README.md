This is the final project for the University of Wisconsin Data Science and Analytics Bootcamp business intelligence section. The project utilized Tableau Public to make a simple interactive dashboard. The data set was provided in .csv and needed minimal cleaning.  Requirements included, creating parameters and measures, applying filters, enhancing tooltips, and presenting a visually appealing display.  The dashboard is interactive and viewable on Tableau Public by clicking the [picture](https://public.tableau.com/views/BusinessIntelligenceFinalProject_16763102730270/EarthquakeDashboard?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) above, and the cleaned data set is [here](/Quaker_Property_and_Casualty/).
