# Mammographic Predicition with BI-RADS Assessments

> "Find a dataset on a subject you care about, and do something with it."  -- Sincerly your instructor

Those were the instructions for the third milestone project from the University of Wisconsin Data Science and Analytics Bootcamp, and this is truly a personal project.  My wife is a breast cancer survivor you see.

The presentation begins by recounting a conversation we had with her surgeon, and happily ends with her cancer free with a 92% 5-year survival probability.  Along the way, I touch on the dataset and what BI-RADS are, while we do a little exploratory data analysis.
