        "The final project is intended to simulate participation in a Kaggle competition. Your challenge is to build the most accurate model for predicting which passangers would survive the sinking of the *Titanic*. The ***Titanic Machine Learning Final Project.ipynb*** Colab notebook provides some guidance for tackling the project and suggests some things to think about as you get started. However, many of the model-building decisions are left up to you. \n",

        "Kaggle was started in 2010 as a platform for machine learning competitions, which aim to identify how best to optimize supervised learning problems. These initiatives offer a two-way benefit. They help companies improve their internal algorithms and they provide prospective data professionals opportunities to prove their worth.\n",
        "\n",
        "Though Kaggle usually has a singular aim of maximizing a specific metric, the idea of finding the best possible algorithm and furthermore optimizing its hyperparameters is the daily task of a data scientist. Moreover, success in Kaggle can be great for a future resume (since your information is saved on their site).\n",
        "\n",
        "Obviously, the timeframe for this lesson is not realistic in terms of a typical Kaggle workflow, as competitors spend weeks or even months optimizing every piece of an algorithm they can. However, you can get started with preliminary testing and use these principles to enter your own Kaggle competitions in the future!"
