*	Using BI-RADS assessment data, developed multiple machine learning classification models to predict malignant breast cancer tumors and reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies.
*	Utilized Python for data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, encoding, machine learning pipeline development, and hyperparameter tuning.
*	Presented results to faculty and students virtually, via Zoom and Microsoft PowerPoint, as the capstone project for the University of Wisconsin Data Science and Analytics Bootcamp.

This is the final project for the University of Wisconsin Data Science and Analytics Bootcamp business intelligence section. The project utilized Tableau Public to make a simple interactive dashboard. The data set was provided in .csv and needed minimal cleaning.  Requirements included, creating parameters and measures, applying filters, enhancing tooltips, and presenting a visually appealing display.  The dashboard is interactive and viewable on Tableau Public by clicking the [picture](https://public.tableau.com/views/BusinessIntelligenceFinalProject_16763102730270/EarthquakeDashboard?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) above, and the cleaned data set is [here](/Quaker_Property_and_Casualty/).
