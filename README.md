# Data Science & Analytics Portfolio
In addition to personal projects, this repository contains projects and visualizations created during the University of Wisconsin Data Science and Analytics Professional Certificate course.

## Machine Learning

This is the capstone project for the University of Wisconsin Data Science and Analytics Professional Certificate.  The instructions were simply, "Find a data set on a subject you care about and do something with it."  By applying a machine learning model to BI-RADS assessment data, the project seeks to improve diagnostic precision in identifying malignant breast cancer tumors, and reduce the number of unnecessary breast biopsies.  The code is contained in a [Google Colaboratory](/Mammographic%20Prediction%20with%20BI-RADS%20Assessments/Milestone_Project_3_Mammography.ipynb) notebook.  It utilizes Python for data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, encoding, machine learning pipeline development, and hyperparameter tuning.  Prominent libraries include Pandas, Scikit Learn, Matplotlib, and Plotly.  Several machine learning models were developed to determine which produced the best precision.

## Business Intelligence

This is the final project for the University of Wisconsin Data Science and Analytics Professional Certificate business intelligence section. The project utilized Tableau Public to make a simple interactive dashboard. The data set was provided in .csv and needed minimal cleaning.  Requirements included, creating parameters and measures, applying filters, enhancing tooltips, and presenting a visually appealing display.  The dashboard is interactive and viewable on Tableau Public by clicking the [picture](https://public.tableau.com/views/BusinessIntelligenceFinalProject_16763102730270/EarthquakeDashboard?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) above, and the cleaned data set is [here](/Quaker_Property_and_Casualty/).
