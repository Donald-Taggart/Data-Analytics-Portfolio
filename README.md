[Mammographic Prediction with BI-RADS Assessments](Donald-Taggart/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/Mammographic%20Prediction%20with%20BI-RADS%20Assessments/)

*	Using BI-RADS assessment data, developed multiple machine learning classification models to predict malignant breast cancer tumors and reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies.
*	Utilized Python for data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, encoding, machine learning pipeline development, and hyperparameter tuning.
*	Presented results to faculty and students virtually, via Zoom and Microsoft PowerPoint, as the capstone project for the University of Wisconsin Data Science and Analytics Bootcamp.
